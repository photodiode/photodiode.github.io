<h1>This blog and why it is</h1>
<time datetime="2021-04-13">2021.04.13</time>

<p>After years and years, basically forever, of doing small projects and never truly finishing them, letting them rot on some hard drive, I have decided to make a small blog where I can post whatever I might have learned or found useful from these spurs of creativity. Things I should share instead of keeping secret because they might be that killer product that will make me unbelievably rich. (they probably aren't)</p>
<p>Most of them will be programming or computer related, I think.</p>
<p>When looking into various ways of making a simple blog I got kind of overwhelmed by the amount of static blog generators available. Though none seemed to satisfy my simple needs.</p>
<p>I wanted to have a really small website where I could write my "articles" as markdown documents and just regenerate the site with a template. I am sure many generators can do this, but I ended up writing a simple <a href="https://github.com/photodiode/photodiode.github.io/blob/master/publish">Python script</a> instead. Why? Why not? Maybe I'll find something later.</p>
<p>If you ignore the attempts at line numbering and syntax coloring (gotta put that in a separate file) then all it does is read .md files, convert them and put them into my template html.</p>
<p>For compressing the SVG files I used this neat online tool: <a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/">jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg</a></p>
<p>And for the colors.. I am still undecided. Please have a look at all the themes included in the css.</p>
