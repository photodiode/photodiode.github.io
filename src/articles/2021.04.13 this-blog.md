# This blog and why it is

After years and years, basically forever, of doing small projects and never truly finishing them, letting them rot on some hard drive, I have decided to make a small blog where I can post whatever I might have learned or found useful from these spurs of creativity. Things I should share instead of keeping secret because they might be that killer product that will make me unbelievably rich. (they probably aren't)

Most of them will be programming or computer related, I think.

When looking into various ways of making a simple blog I got kind of overwhelmed by the amount of static blog generators available. Though none seemed to satisfy my simple needs.

I wanted to have a really small website where I could write my "articles" as markdown documents and just regenerate the site with a template. I am sure many generators can do this, but I ended up writing a simple [Python script](https://github.com/photodiode/photodiode.github.io/blob/master/publish) instead. Why? Why not? Maybe I'll find something later.

If you ignore the attempts at line numbering and syntax coloring (gotta put that in a separate file) then all it does is read .md files, convert them and put them into my template html.

For compressing the SVG files I used this neat online tool: [jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)

And for the colors.. I am still undecided. Please have a look at all the themes included in the css.
